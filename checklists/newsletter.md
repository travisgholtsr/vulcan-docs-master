# Newsletter Pre-Publish Checklist

### Before sending the Friday newsletter:

- [ ] Load content into MailChimp template and proof *(Login in the INN 1password vault)*
- [ ] Send test email from MailChimp to [nerds@inn.org](mailto:nerds@inn.org) and any apprentices not on the nerds@inn.org list.
- [ ] Make sure at least two other team members read through the test email for style, grammar, link checks and gut checks about any questionable content choices.
- [ ] Check each link and confirm it works
- [ ] Run images and GIFs through [an optimizer](http://ezgif.com/optimize)
- [ ] Proof subject line(s) with extra care
- [ ] Check for any exclusionary language ("guys" "dudes" "ninjas" etc.) or potentially offensive content
- [ ] Do a final call for newsletter sign ups on social media

### After sending the Friday newsletter:

- [ ] Create blog post and publish. This is the link to share.
- [ ] Tweet the nerds.inn.org link from the [@INNnerds](http://twitter.com/innnerds) Twitter account. Don't just stick to the subject line. Emoji, images and/or the newsletter GIF will generally make your tweet more effective
- [ ] Notify the rest of the team to share the link (or retweet the @INNnerds link) with their followers.
- [ ] Consider scheduling some more tweets (using Tweetdeck or Buffer):
  1. If there was a guest, make sure to thank them. This can either come from your personal account (for the personal touch) or from @INNNerds. @tag the guest if they're on Twitter themselves.
  2. Schedule ICYMI tweet for Sunday evening catchup time (4-5 PM PT / 7-8 PM ET)
  3. If we made a thing, tweet that thing! Give 15-45 minute padding from other scheduled tweets. If it was a Largo thing, you'll likely want tweet from @LargoProject and then retweet that tweet from @INNNerds.

### Tips
- **On writing**... less is more.
- **On MailChimp**... be careful when copying and pasting from the newsletter draft to the MailChimp WYSIWYG editor. Check mode or edit raw code. You don't want to wipe out existing styles.
- **On GIFs**... Keep the gif between 400-500 wide, shorter than 3.33 seconds. [Resize and optimize it](http://ezgif.com/optimize).
