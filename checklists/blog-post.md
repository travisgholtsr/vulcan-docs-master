# Blog post

### Headline

- [ ] First letter of all major words are capitalized
- [ ] Headline is not too click-baity but still compelling enough to get people to read
- [ ] Typically under 72 characters to keep Google happy

### Post body

- [ ] Copy edited (check spelling, grammar, formatting, etc.)
- [ ] Liven things up with an intro paragraph (use css class "intro" on any paragraph tag), some subheads, pull quotes, visual elements where applicable
- [ ] Photos in the post body have captions and credits
- [ ] Photos should use the "link to - none" option unless it's a photo from a source we want to credit by linking back to the original photo/page (creative commons, etc.)

### Featured image

- [ ] All posts should have a featured image if at all possible
- [ ] Make sure the square crop doesn't look dumb
- [ ] Use a photo large enough to work as the lead image at the top of the post and/or use the "override featured image" option in Largo to hide it

### Excerpt

- [ ] All posts should have the WordPress custom excerpt field filled out (don't use the more tag or let WordPress clip the post off for you because that normally looks bad)
- [ ] Try to keep it short (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] With the headline and photo, the excerpt's job is to give people enough information to know what the post is about and to get them to click-through to the article

### Categories and Tags

- [ ] Make sure the post is in at least one category (and not in the uncategorized category)
- [ ] Give the post some tags but don't overdo it. 4-8 is probably a good number for most of our posts.
- [ ] Tags are always capitalized and usually plural, prefer "Conferences" to "conference" and always use full names of people and places without titles (e.g. "Barack Obama" and not "President Obama" or "President Barack Obama")
- [ ] Largo lets you specify a single category or tag to be the "top term" for any given post. Always double check to make sure that is set to something reasonable.

### Misc

- [ ] Optionally you can specify related posts in Largo (currently just using the post ID of the related post(s)) so if you know there are other posts closely related to the one you're writing you might want to do that.
- [ ] Update the editorial calendar with the link to the finished post, move it to the "published" tab
- [ ] Tweet from [@INNnerds](http://twitter.com/innnerds) and personal accounts
- [ ] Let the rest of the team know it's published so they can share it too
- [ ] If the post is applicable for any of the regular INN newsletters let the editor of that newsletter know it exists by emailing [news@inn.org](news@inn.org). This is also the way to get it scheduled to be tweeted from main INN account and/or posted on Facebook
