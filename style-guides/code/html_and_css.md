# Best Practices for HTML and CSS

* Element IDs and class names should always be ``lowercase-with-dashes``.
* Put modals and JST templates in their own files. If using our fork of the NPR app template these belong in the `templates` and `jst` directories, respectively. When this isn't feasible, put modals in the page footer first, followed by inline javascript templates.
* Don't use negative margins.
