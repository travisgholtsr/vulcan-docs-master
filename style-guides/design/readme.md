#Design Style Guide

We're putting together a style guide to codify the design decisions we make most often:

- Chart and table styles
- Typography direction (font faces, recommended line spacing and length, colors)
- Button styles
- Icons
- CSS interactions and animations
- Form styles
- Interface colors
- Company colors (for all the INN sites and products)
- Branding elements (INN logos, how to use them in context)
- Favicons and other graphics

We've been inspired by:

- [MinnPost's style guide](http://code.minnpost.com/minnpost-styles/)
- [Tribune news apps styles](http://newsapps.github.io/bootstrap/styleguide/)
- [Editorially's style guide](http://editorially.github.io/styleguide/)
- [A List Apart's pattern library](http://patterns.alistapart.com/)
- [MailChimp's pattern library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/)
- And many others. Alan Palazzolo [put together a great list](https://github.com/zzolo/srccon-style-guide-discussion) to check out for more inspiration.
