# A few general thoughts on documentation/training...

Just to put a few general notes, thoughts down as a place to start. Add/improve on this, it's by no means a complete list.


### Audiences:

**Managers/Executives**

- What do they need to make sound strategic decisions about technology for their organizations?
- How does Largo fit into this picture? How do we "sell" them on our approach? What else should we build?
- What are some possible areas for training, development of resources on best practices, etc.? Particularly, where are there gaps? Any unique opportunities given our membership and our position in the nonprofit/journalism/tech ecosystem?

**Tech folks at members (and elsewhere)**

- Some level of tech knowledge, sometimes advanced, sometimes just starting out but willing to learn
- Make sure we're sharing best practices, acting as a resource, particularly for lone developers at member orgs and particularly for those trying to learn
- Often, re: WordPress in particular, people learn by hacking on a theme, building their first site, etc. let's make sure Largo is a shining example of doing things the right way with adequate developer docs explaining as many of our technical decisions as possible (and not assuming any base level of knowledge)
- Training opportunities? dev bootcamp model? Maybe minting "Largo certified developers"? Avoid the general "learn to code" thing because it's covered well elsewhere, but maybe partnerships, negotiating discounts on other training, etc.?

**Non-technical users (editors, reporters, web producers, etc.)**

- Resources to help them maximize their use of the tools we build and feel completely confident in their use of the tools
- Have sufficient self-service resources available to answer their questions (reduce support volume)
- Build in best practices...meaning, as we make decisions about features in Largo and the publishing experience, how do we gently nudge less-experienced folks to make better decisions/tell stories more effectively?
- What kind of training might we offer? Same issue as above, avoid the general stuff/reinventing the wheel, but what are we uniquely positioned to offer?


### Goals

- Help our member organizations feel 100% confident in their technology decisions + learn from each other (and from us)
- Aim for 0% duplication of effort; 100% member satisfaction
- Share everything, be ultra-transparent about our thought process at every turn
- Treat documentation and support as a product, with its own roadmap for continuous improvement
- Apply the same rigor/methodology to our docs/support process/training resources as we do any other project
- Become the example that people point to when asked "who does documentation really well?"
- Teaching hospital model for our apprenticeship program, continue to build this out, focus on diversity + filling gaps left by journalism programs + developing a pipeline of folks who want to work in nonprofit news


### To Do

- Document our entire support process + share publicly
	- make it clear how to get help
	- set expectations for response times, resolution, etc.
	- better explain what members get for free vs. what they have to pay for (and why)
	- establish some metrics so we can measure and improve over time
	- right now we're not really following up after a ticket is closed, need a better procedure for that
- Go through existing help desk tickets and identify FAQs, common issues
	- use these to identify areas where docs need improvement
	- create knowledgebase entries for anything that can be made generalizable
	- feedback into our product roadmap where applicable
- One-pagers or more detailed proposals for current/prospective funders on anything we think might be worth sharing with them

### Questions

- Largo knowledgebase (http://confluence.inn.org/display/LKB/Largo+Knowledge+Base) is really just a shell at this point, what can we do to make this more visible/useful?
- How can we better highlight success stories from folks using the products we build?
- How can we better engage with the open source community? Build a more robuse network of contributors to our projects?
