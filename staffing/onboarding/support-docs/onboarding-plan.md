# Jack Brighton - Onboarding Plan

#### Welcome to the team, we're super stoked to have you!

To help you with the transition and make it easy for you to get up to speed as quickly as possible, here's an outline of some things to look at in your first couple of weeks with us. This is not intended to be a complete list and the details may change a bit depending on how the first couple of weeks go, but we hope this overview is helpful to give you some structure and place to start digging in. 

**Some general words of advice:**

- Take ample notes
- Ask lots of questions
- Check in regularly
- It's ok to wander
- You're doing great


### Week 1

- **Set up your computer and workspace** - Work through [this guide](/staffing/onboarding/os-x-setup.md) to setting up Mac OS X for news apps work. If you need additional hardware/software work with your supervisor to make the necessary purchases.
- **You'll also want to spend some time getting your working environment set up.** If you're new to remote work we've collected [some tips](/how-we-work/remote-work.md) and [tools](/how-we-work/tools.md) we've found useful. Feel free to add to any of these lists.
- **Create/activate all accounts** - We have [a list of them here](/staffing/onboarding/accounts.md). If you run into anything that's not on the list, add it.
- **Read all of the [team docs](http://github.com/inn/docs)**. Create issues for anything that is unclear. Fork the repo, suggest improvements and submit pull requests wherever relevant. If you're new to using Git, [we have a guide for that](/how-to-work-with-us/via-github.md).
- **Schedule meetings with all INN staff members** - in your first couple of weeks you'll want to spend a little time with each INN staff member (not just our immediate team) to get to know them, their role with the organization and how your work might overlap.
- **Read the docs for [Largo](http://largo.readthedocs.org) and our [deploy tools](https://github.com/INN/deploy-tools)**. If anything is unclear, create a GitHub issue. Propose additions/improvements and submit pull requests wherever relevant.
- Once you've read through these docs you'll want to [set up your local machine](/projects/largo/umbrella-setup.md) to work on our WordPress stuff. Pair with a buddy to get a walkthrough and continue to improve the docs if anything is unclear.
- **Take a look at the admin side of the Largo help desk** and make sure you're clear on how it works. Start working on documentation for our support process.
- **Collect your notes and thoughts**, reflect on your first week and write a blog post on the [team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) about what you've learned.

### Week 2

- **Start spending some time on each INN member site.** There are [a lot of them](http://inn.org/members) so this is going to take you a while, spread it out over the next couple of weeks. You're not looking for anything in particular but you should at least try to get familiar with what each member does, the topics they cover, what their site does well/less well. Take some notes and start thinking about where we might be able to help.
- **Continue meetings with INN staff** - try to make sure you've met everyone and spent a little time with them by the end of this week.
- **Begin a more careful review of all existing Largo documentation** and open issues wherever you notice gaps. Make small improvements as you go but don't worry about filling all of the gaps right away.
- **Review the existing entries in the Largo knowledgebase** and make improvements wherever applicable.
- **As help desk tickets come in, work with other team members to try to resolve them**. Try to pair with other folks on the team as they fix bugs, answer questions, etc. so you pick things up along the way.
- **Collect your notes**, reflect on the week and write another blog post about what you've learned.

### Week 3

- **Read the docs for [our other projects on GitHub](https://github.com/INN)**. If anything is unclear, create an issue. Propose additions/improvements and submit pull requests wherever relevant.
- **Continue spending time on INN member sites**. If a particular member interests you, maybe reach out to them and have a quick chat to introduce yourself and learn a little more about them.
- **Ease into some member/client projects**. Specifically, you'll be starting with a project to help Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations get setup with the Public Media Platform. We'll go through what needs to be done here and I'll make the necessary intros before I leave for vacation.
- **Go through older/closed help desk tickets** and identify any common issues not covered by existing documentation or knowledgebase articles. Add them to the documentation or knowledgebase where applicable.
- **Collect your notes**, reflect, write another blog post about what you've learned. (Notice a pattern?)

### Week 4

- **You've probably opened a lot of documentation-related issues** on our various project repos as you've been learning. This week take the opportunity to work on closing a few of the more substantial ones.
- **Continue spending time on INN member sites**. You'll probably complete this this week.
- **Continue pairing** and learn as much as you can. You'll probably start to spend more time driving as you become more comfortable and get up to speed with our projects and how we work.
- **Spend some time thinking about training**. Now that you're familiar with existing documentation, our support process, etc. start thinking about what else we might do to help our members succeed.
- **Collect your notes**, reflect, yet another blog post.

### Weeks 5-8

After the first four weeks you should be reasonably comfortable with how the team works and the projects we're working on. At this point you'll likely be managing the support queue (mostly) on your own and start to be assigned some work of your own on member/client and internal projects. Continue to ask questions and check in regularly (don't ever stop doing this, really) if anything is unclear or if you need a hand. You'll also start to think more about longer-term ways to improve our documentation, support process and training offerings.

### 60 Day Review

Both full-time and part-time employees have a review at 60 days. This is less formal than your annual review but it's still an important opportunity to check in with your supervisor about how things have been going, set goals for the coming months and identify areas for improvement. For bonus-eligible employees this will also be the time to set some goals for the year.
